GeographicLib
=============

GeographicLib is a small set of C++ classes for performing conversions between geographic, UTM, UPS, MGRS, geocentric, and local cartesian coordinates, for gravity (e.g., EGM2008), geoid height, and geomagnetic field (e.g., WMM2010) calculations, and for **solving geodesic problems**. (The library may be used from .NET applications using the NETGeographicLib wrapper library.) It is a suitable replacement for the core functionality provided by geotrans. The library is licensed under the MIT/X11 License.
